# The Evolution of Todo – From Console App to Cloud-Native AI System Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-Driven Development
All code must be generated strictly from written specifications. No implementation without a corresponding spec that clearly defines the requirements, behavior, and acceptance criteria.

### No Manual Coding
Developers may not write or edit code manually; only specification refinement is allowed. All code generation must be driven through automated tools and agents based on specifications.

### Progressive Evolution
Each phase must build logically on the previous phase without breaking architectural integrity. Changes must maintain backward compatibility where specified and follow a clear evolutionary path.

### Reusable Intelligence
Skills, reusable templates, and agent roles must be explicitly defined and applied across all phases. Reusable intelligence ensures consistency and reduces redundancy throughout the project lifecycle.

### Deterministic Behavior
System outputs must be predictable and testable at every phase. All functionality must exhibit deterministic behavior with clear inputs producing consistent, verifiable outputs.

### Clean Architecture
Clear separation of concerns must be maintained throughout all phases. Architecture should follow clean design principles with well-defined boundaries between components, layers, and responsibilities.

### Reusability First
Agents and skills designed in Phase I must be usable in later phases without modification. Design for reusability from the initial phase, ensuring components are generalizable and adaptable for future phases.

## Technology Stack and Phase Requirements
The project follows a structured five-phase evolution: Phase I (In-Memory Python Console App), Phase II (Full-Stack Web Application with Next.js/FastAPI), Phase III (AI-Powered Todo Chatbot), Phase IV (Local Kubernetes Deployment), and Phase V (Advanced Cloud Deployment). Each phase builds on the previous while maintaining core principles.

## Development Workflow
All development follows the spec-driven approach: spec → plan → tasks → implement. Each phase must be fully implemented before advancing to the next. Reusable intelligence (agents, skills, templates) created in earlier phases must remain functional in later phases without modification.

## Governance

All project work must comply with the core principles stated above. No code changes are permitted outside the spec-driven development process. Any deviations from these principles require formal constitution amendments with clear justification and approval from project stakeholders.

Versioning follows semantic versioning: MAJOR for breaking governance/principle changes, MINOR for new principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications or corrections.
